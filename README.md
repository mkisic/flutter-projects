# flutter-projects
In this repository you can find projects which I wrote during various Flutter courses.


## I am rich
This is simple application which is doing nothing.
Idea is taken from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich).


## Mi Card
This applicaton uses some basic layouts to show contact details.
